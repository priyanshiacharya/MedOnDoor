🚑 MedOnDoor – Community Healthcare Service Platform

**Overview**

MedOnDoor is a full-stack web application designed to connect users (patients) with healthcare service providers such as doctors, nurses, and medicine delivery personnel.
The platform enables secure authentication, service booking, provider job management, and a rating system, while handling real-world concurrency and race-condition problems at the backend level.

**Problem Statement**

Accessing timely and reliable healthcare services can be difficult, especially when users need home-based medical assistance.
MedOnDoor aims to simplify this by providing a single platform where users can request medical services and qualified providers can accept and complete those requests efficiently and securely.

**Features**

**User (Patient) Features**

- User registration and login
- Secure authentication using JWT
- Ability to book healthcare services:
  - Doctor consultation
  - Nurse home visit
  - Medicine delivery
- View booking status:
  - PENDING
  - ACCEPTED

- Logout functionality
- Role-based access control (users cannot access provider dashboards)

**Service Provider Features**

- Provider registration with service type selection

- View only their own accepted bookings
- Mark accepted bookings as completed
- Logout functionality

**Rating & Review System**

- Users can rate a service only after the booking is marked COMPLETED
- Rating scale enforced (1–5)
- Optional review/comment
- Ratings are linked to:
  - Booking
  - User
  - Provider
- Prevents invalid or premature ratings

**Authentication & Security**

- Password hashing using bcrypt
- JWT-based stateless authentication
- Token verification middleware for protected routes
- Role-based authorization enforced at backend
- Frontend route protection using token and role checks
- Unauthorized users are redirected to login

**Clever Backend Logic & Safeguards**

**Job Claiming Logic (Marketplace Safety)**

- Multiple providers can initially see the same PENDING booking
- Only one provider can accept a booking
- Once accepted:
  - The booking disappears from all other providers’ dashboards
  - Remains visible only to the provider who accepted it

**Race Condition Prevention**

- Booking acceptance is enforced at the database level using conditional SQL:
  - `WHERE status = 'PENDING'`

- Prevents two providers from accepting the same job simultaneously
- Backend checks affected rows to confirm acceptance
- Ensures atomic and concurrency-safe job assignment

**Double-Click Prevention**

- Accept button is disabled immediately after clicking
- Button text changes to “Accepting…” for user feedback
- Prevents accidental multiple requests from the same provider
- Backend logic still enforces safety even if frontend is bypassed

**State-Based UI Rendering**

- Provider dashboard dynamically updates based on booking status:
  - PENDING → Accept button
  - ACCEPTED → Mark Completed button
- Completed bookings are removed from provider dashboard
- User booking history clearly reflects status transitions

**Booking Lifecycle**

- PENDING → ACCEPTED → COMPLETED

- Users create bookings
- Providers accept and complete bookings
- Status transitions are strictly controlled by backend
- Users cannot manipulate booking status
- Providers cannot complete unaccepted bookings
